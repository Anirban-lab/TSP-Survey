# Abstract
Combinatorial optimization problems operate on a set of problems, which have a range of feasible solutions either discrete in nature or can be minimized to discrete. The primary objective comprises finding the best solution. One of the prevalent problems of combinatorial optimization is the travelling salesman problem (TSP). In this article, we have studied four heuristic algorithms for solving TSP: (a) genetic algorithm combined with ant colony optimization, local-opt and remove sharp heuristics, (b) nearest neighbour, (c) simulated annealing and (d) tabu search. We have compared the best-known optimal value for specific TSP instances with these four algorithms.
